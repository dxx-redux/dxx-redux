Compiling D1X-Redux Sourcecode

This file describes how to compile D1X-Redux from Source. There are also binary packages available from
https://dxx-redux.com


Requirements:
=============

   1. C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++ or MSVC)
   2. CMake
   3. SDL(-devel)
   4. PhysFS(-devel)
   5. GLU/GL
   6. GLEW
   7. libpng
   8. NASM (optional for Assembler-based Texture-mapper in non-OpenGL Build)
   9. SDL_mixer(-devel) (+ dependencies) for external music support


Compiling:
==========

   Type 'cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo' to prepare the build.
   Type 'cmake --build build' to compile the build.
   You can also give additional options like 'cmake -DOPENGL=OFF'. See
   'cmake -LH -B build' for available options.


Needed files:
=============

   Since D1X-Redux is a Sourceport of the Descent-Engine you will need the Game-Content data files to run
   the game. You don't own the full game, yet?
   Just visit GOOD OLD GAMES via:
   https://www.gog.com/game/descent
   and download it for a very low price! DRM-FREE!

   Following files are needed to run the game:
   descent.hog
   descent.pig

   For the Mac CD-ROM, download The Unarchiver (http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html) and drag the
   installer program onto it. Alternatively, for Mac OS 9 or earlier simply run the installer.

   Of course you can also use the Shareware game content with D1X-Redux which you can find here:
   https://dxx-redux.com/dl/descent-pc-shareware.zip

   For the PC CD-ROM, these files should be located on the Descent1 CD-Rom. The PC version data files need
   to be patched to version 1.4a.

   There is a patch suitable for Windows/Unix/Mac OS X available at:
   https://dxx-redux.com/dl/descent-game-content-10to14a-patch.zip

   To play the Multiplayer levelset 'Total Chaos', make sure the files

   chaos.hog
   chaos.msn

   are in the subdirectory 'Missions'. These files should also be located on the Descent1 CD. For the
   Mac CD data, simply move these files, after installing, from 'Data' to 'Missions'.


Where to put these files:
=========================

   *NIX
   ----
   The Sharepath (/usr/share/games/d1x-redux by default) or
   ~/.d1x-redux or
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini

   MacOS
   -----
   Same directory as where the binary is located or
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini

   Win32
   -----
   Same directory as where the binary is located
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini
   

Optional files:
===============

   D1X-Redux is expandable. You can add additional content to the game.

   Missions:
   ---------
   Those can be found on several websites. Add them to the game by copying them to subdirectory
   ‘missions/’. They can also go in subdirectories of 'missions/', unlike with the original version.
   A good place to find additional mission might be the Descent Mission Archive:
   https://sectorgame.com/dxma/

   Custom Music (MP3, OGG, AIF, etc.):
   -----------------------------------
   Custom Music can be played via the CUSTOM MUSIC options by specifying it in the Sound Options menu.
   Please note that all custom music has to be in 44Khz format. Supported formats depend on the capabilities of SDL_mixer.

   AddOn Packs:
   ------------
   Custom AddOn packs will expand the game in many differnt ways. These are usually provided as ZIP or 7Z and can easily
   be installed by putting them to where your game content resides (OS-dependent - see above).
   NO EXTRACTION OR ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION NEEDED.
   AddOns for D1X-Rebirth generally also work with D1X-Redux, see for example:
   https://web.archive.org/web/20160515232548/http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/addons/

Launching the program
=====================

   *NIX
   ----
   After compiling and installing, the program can be launched with the command: d1x-redux

   MacOS
   -----
   Simply double-click "D1X-Redux".

   Win32
   -----
   Doubleclick d1x-redux.exe

   To see a full list of available command-line options append ‘-h’, ‘-?’ to the command or refer file
