Compiling D2X-Redux Sourcecode

This file describes how to compile D2X-Redux from Source. There are also binary packages available from
https://dxx-redux.com


Requirements:
=============

   1. C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++ or MSVC)
   2. CMake
   3. SDL(-devel)
   4. PhysFS(-devel)
   5. GLU/GL
   6. GLEW
   7. libpng
   8. NASM (optional for Assembler-based Texture-mapper in non-OpenGL Build)
   9. SDL_mixer(-devel) (+ dependencies) for external music support


Compiling:
==========

   Type 'cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo' to prepare the build.
   Type 'cmake --build build' to compile the build.
   You can also give additional options like 'cmake -DOPENGL=OFF'. See
   'cmake -LH -B build' for available options.
   

Needed files:
=============

   Since D2X-Redux is a Sourceport of the Descent2-Engine you will need the Game-Content data files to run
   the game. You don't own the full game, yet?
   Just visit GOOD OLD GAMES via:
   https://www.gog.com/game/descent_2
   and download it for a very low price! DRM-FREE!

   Following files are needed to run the game:
   descent2.ham
   descent2.hog
   descent2.s11
   descent2.s22
   alien1.pig
   alien2.pig
   fire.pig
   groupa.pig
   ice.pig
   water.pig
   intro-h.mvl and/or intro-l.mvl
   other-h.mvl and/or other-l.mvl
   robots-h.mvl and/or robots-l.mvl

   With the PC version, these files - except the Movies (*.mvl) - are archived in the file
   'descent2.sow' on the Descent2 CD-Rom.
   This is an ARJ-archive and can be extracted with an adapted archiver like ‘unarj’ or by installing the
   game on a Windows/DOS system.

   Note that the above files must be lowercase if you use an operating system with case-sensitive file management.

   For the Mac CD-ROM, download The Unarchiver (http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html) and drag the
   installer program onto it. Alternatively, for Mac OS 9 or earlier simply run the installer.
   Unfortunately the movies do not work; if you want the movies consider purchasing Descent 2 for PC
   (e.g. from Good Old Games) and extract that installer with The Unarchiver. Hey, then you'll have
   another license for multiplayer. ;)

   Of course you can also use the Interactive Demo game content with D2X-Redux which you can find here:
   https://dxx-redux.com/dl/descent2-pc-demo.zip


Where to put these files:
=========================

   *NIX
   ----
   The Sharepath (/usr/share/games/d1x-redux by default) or
   ~/.d1x-redux or
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini

   MacOS
   -----
   Same directory as where the binary is located or
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini

   Win32
   -----
   Same directory as where the binary is located
   another directory specified by -hogdir via d1x.ini
   

Optional files:
===============

   D2X-Redux is expandable. You can add additional content to the game.

   Vertigo series AddOn
   --------------------
   Can be added by copying the files
   d2x-h.mvl and/or d2x-l.mvl, hoard.ham to your game-directory/Sharepath and
   d2x.hog, d2x.mn2 to 'missions/' subdirectory.
   All these files should be located on the ‘Vertigo Series’ CD-Rom

   Missions:
   ---------
   Those can be found on several websites. Add them to the game by copying them to subdirectory
   ‘missions/’. They can also go in subdirectories of 'missions/', unlike with the original version.
   A good place to find additional mission might be the Descent Mission Archive:
   https://sectorgame.com/dxma/

   Custom Music (MP3, OGG, AIF, etc.):
   -----------------------------------
   Custom Music can be played via the CUSTOM MUSIC options by specifying it in the Sound Options menu.
   Please note that all custom music has to be in 44Khz format. Supported formats depend on the capabilities of SDL_mixer.

   AddOn Packs:
   ------------
   Custom AddOn packs will expand the game in many differnt ways. These are usually provided as ZIP or 7Z and can easily
   be installed by putting them to where your game content resides (OS-dependent - see above).
   NO EXTRACTION OR ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION NEEDED.
   AddOns for D2X-Rebirth generally also work with D2X-Redux, see for example:
   https://web.archive.org/web/20160515232548/http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/addons/
   

Launching the program
=====================

   *NIX
   ----
   After compiling and installing, the program can be launched with the command: d2x-redux

   MacOS
   -----
   Simply double-click "D2X-Redux".

   Win32
   -----
   Doubleclick d2x-redux.exe

   To see a full list of available command-line options append ‘-h’, ‘-?’ to the command or refer file
